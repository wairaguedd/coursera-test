			Sushi
			</section>
			<p>
			A meal from Asia. From Japan comes this enjoyable meal. Sushi can be prepared with brown rice, but traditionally it is made with medium grain white rice. It is often prepared with raw seafood, but some varieties of sushi use cooked ingredients such as calamari, eel, and imitation crab meat. Many others are vegetarian. Sushi is often served with pickled ginger (gari), wasabi (or horseradish paste), and soy sauce (or tamari). Daikon radish is popular as a garnish.
